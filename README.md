# Claude Settings
A public repository where I unify all my personal settings for my Claude Code's implementation at a general level.

## File structure
- [`general-settings`](./general-settings.md): For Claude at an user/general level.

## Have in mind
- I work as a full-stack developer, focused on JavaScript/TypeScript and learning Python, so the used prompts and AI-oriented tools are focused on that direction.
- All prompts have been reviewed with Grammarly for a correct English description.
- I do not configure any `AGENTS.md`, I prefer to focus on using SKILLS, which are the following:
  - `ui-ux-pro-max`
  - `frontend-design`
  - `vercel-react-best-practices`
  - `brainstorming`
  - `web-design-guidelines`
  - `next-best-practices`
- I base all my code improvements on my-to-day work and my [references file](./REFERENCES.md).
