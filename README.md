# Claude Settings
A public repository where I unify all my personal settings for my Claude Code's implementation at a general level.

Some points to have in mind:
- I work as a full-stack developer, focused on JavaScript/TypeScript and learning Python.
- I do not configure any `AGENTS.md`, I prefer to focus on using SKILLS, which are the following:
  - `ui-ux-pro-max`
  - `frontend-design`
  - `vercel-react-best-practices`
  - `brainstorming`
  - `web-design-guidelines`
  - `next-best-practices`
